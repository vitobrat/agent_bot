## Description

This bot is created to keep you updated with the latest news in the world of cryptocurrencies💲.
The bot contains the latest news articles about cryptocurrencies as well as a smart assistant,
who will answer all cryptocurrency-related queries.
To use it, just send messages.
Provide as much detail as possible (what information you're interested in and about which cryptocurrency) 
and remember that the bot only relies on information from public sources, 
which may contain incorrect information, and does not know the entire current market situation.
